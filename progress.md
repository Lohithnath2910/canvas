# Canvas — Progress Log

**Last updated:** 2026-08-24
**Current position:** Stage 0 done. Sticky note shell built and compiling; awaiting a verification pass before S1-15 (CRDT doc).

## Standing update rule

After implementing and testing anything, append a dated entry below with the
correct status marker, and downgrade or remove anything it contradicts. Do
not batch updates — a stale log is worse than no log.

Template:

### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>
- ✅ <what now works> — verified by <manual step or test name>
- 🟡 <what landed but is untested>

Markers: ✅ implemented and confirmed working (name the check) · 🟡 code exists and
compiles, behaviour unconfirmed · ❌ not started.

### 2026-08-24 — Project scaffolding and backlog

- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` copied to the project root — verified present; the five markdown image
  links repointed at `handoff/screenshots/`, spec text otherwise unchanged. `handoff/`
  kept pristine as the reference copy.
- ✅ `TASKS.md` written — 6 Stage 0 tasks, 38 Stage 1 tasks, Stages 2–5 as coarse
  placeholders, plus 5 open questions and a session-end checklist.
- ✅ Rust toolchain confirmed present — `cargo 1.94.0`, `rustc 1.94.0`, `git 2.51.0`,
  verified by `--version` on each.
- ❌ Crate versions from §3 (`slint` 1.17.x, `yrs` 0.19.x, …) not yet checked for
  resolution — that is task `S0-1` and it gates everything after it.
- ❌ No cargo workspace, no crates, no code.

**Not verified:** nothing has been run or rendered. Every §5–§13 spec detail is still
unproven against the actually-installed crate versions.

### 2026-08-24 — Stage 0 complete, sticky note shell standing

**Stack (S0-1)**
- ✅ Everything resolves, and to the exact versions §11/§13 were verified against:
  `slint`/`slint-build` **1.17.1**, `yrs` **0.19.2**, `rusqlite` 0.32.1, `tokio` 1.53.1,
  `uuid` 1.25.0, `mimalloc` 0.1.52. Every API pattern in the spec applies verbatim —
  no re-verification needed. Verified with a throwaway probe crate in the scratchpad.

**Workspace (S0-2, S0-4, S0-6)**
- ✅ Five crates, versions pinned once in `[workspace.dependencies]`.
- ✅ `slint` built with `default-features = false` — only `compat-1-2`, `std`,
  `backend-winit`, `renderer-software`. Drops femtovg, system-tray and accessibility
  from the default build. **Deviation to flag:** §3 describes `--gpu` as a pure runtime
  flag, but a runtime flag requires femtovg compiled in permanently, which contradicts
  "lightest". GPU is now opt-in twice: the `gpu` cargo feature *and* `--gpu` at runtime.
  Without the feature, `--gpu` prints a clear message instead of silently ignoring you.
- ✅ Release profile: `opt-level="z"`, fat LTO, 1 codegen unit, panic=abort, stripped.
- ✅ `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` clean.

**Budget baseline (S0-5)** — release build, software renderer, single note window
- ✅ Working set **20.6 MB** (app idle budget 20–40 MB).
- ✅ Private bytes **7.0 MB** (per-widget budget 5–15 MB).
- ✅ Binary **8.3 MB**.
- ✅ Launch to visible window: **636 ms genuinely cold**, **37–67 ms warm**. The <300 ms
  budget is met warm and missed on a first-ever cold start; disk cache is the difference.
  Recorded honestly rather than quoting only the warm number.

**Theme (S1-01, S1-02, S1-03)**
- ✅ `Palette` — every §5.1 token, both modes, all three light-mode corrections applied.
  No colour literal exists anywhere else in the codebase.
- ✅ Fonts embedded by compile-time `import` of the .ttf per §13.1. Confirmed by eye:
  the title renders in Silkscreen, body prose in the system sans.
- ✅ `Panel` renders with the 0.96 plate, radius 20, 1px edge.
- 🟡 The shadow *deepening on drag* has not been watched happen yet.

**Transparency — resolved, and it changes nothing downstream**
- ✅ Per-pixel window transparency works with the software renderer on Windows 11.
  Confirmed by eye. The 24px `plate-margin` stays, so the drop shadow, the outside
  focus ring and state 9 are all achievable. Had it failed, `Layout.plate-margin` was
  written as the single constant to set to 0.

**Open questions 1 and 2 — answered**
- ✅ **Q2 (always-on-top):** Slint 1.17 exposes `always-on-top` directly on `Window`.
  No dependency outside the closed stack. Hard Constraint 6 is not engaged. Set to true
  per §8.
- ✅ **Q1 (colour control):** decided — it cycles the plate through grey steps
  (`Palette.plate-tone` 0–4, reusing the peer greys). Rule 1 leaves no colour for it to
  set, so it sets grey level, the same mechanism peers are distinguished by.

**Sticky note shell (S1-05..S1-14)** — three bugs found by looking at the real window
- ✅ Header icons render as real vector `Path`s and hover-lighten.
- ✅ Empty state renders.
- ✅ Fixed: **all header content was 16px too high.** It was placed at `y: 0` when the
  32px band actually starts at `y: 16` — the hairline was right, the contents were not.
- ✅ Fixed: **the glyph strip was 23×32, not 23×3.** The §13.4 gotcha bit in a spot the
  spec's own workaround doesn't cover: wrapping it in a plain `Rectangle` is not enough,
  because a layout element still expands to fill a non-layout parent. With the strip at
  full header height, `(parent.height - self.height) / 2` evaluated to 0 and parked it
  against the plate's top corner. It now carries an explicit 23×3.
- ✅ Fixed: **the caret sat on top of the placeholder** instead of after it (§7.6 state 1
  says "caret after"). The input is now offset below the measured placeholder block.
- ✅ Changed: **the plate focus ring no longer keys off body focus.** State 3 says
  focused/editing has "no border/fill/shadow change from state 2", and the body
  auto-focuses on open, so a ring there was permanent and reported nothing. It is now
  driven by a `keyboard-focused` property for the desktop layer to set.
- 🟡 **Everything below is code that compiles and has not been watched work:** drag,
  resize, tab order, the three controls' behaviour, delete confirm, hover reveal,
  the glyph strip's other six states. All await a verification pass.
- ❌ Nothing is persisted yet. No CRDT, no SQLite. `canvas-doc`, `canvas-storage` and
  `canvas-sync` are still empty stubs.

### 2026-08-24 — User-directed design revisions

Three spec deviations, all decided by the user after looking at the running app.
They override the corresponding spec values from here on:

- ✅ **Glyph strip is 8×8 cells with 4px gaps (56×8 total)**, not §6.2's 3×3/2px/23×3.
  At spec size it was unreadable on a real screen. `Layout.dot-size`, `dot-gap`,
  `strip-w`, `strip-h` carry it; the title's left edge moves 51 → 84 to follow.
- ✅ **Header content is vertically centred in its band**: 8px above, 8px below,
  rather than §7.1's 16 above / 0 below. Band total stays 48px, so every body-box
  measurement in §7.3 still holds exactly.
- ✅ **Empty state is a true placeholder**, not §7.6 state 1's two-line block:
  one line of `NOTHING HERE YET` at 25% opacity sitting on the body's first line,
  caret at its start. "Start typing." is removed — it was what pushed the caret
  down a line.

- ✅ **All code comments removed, and no new ones will be written.** User instruction.
  The reasoning behind the non-obvious code (the §13.3 disjoint-TouchArea header
  partition, the §13.4 explicit-size requirement on the glyph strip, why the body uses
  bare `TextInput` rather than `TextEdit`) now lives only in TASKS.md, this log, and
  the git history. Anyone editing the .slint files should read those first — the code
  no longer warns you at the point of the mistake.
- ✅ `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` still clean after the strip.

### 2026-08-24 — Body face becomes the dot-matrix face

- ✅ **Body prose now renders in Silkscreen, not the system sans.** User's call: the
  system sans read as "too generic" next to the dot-matrix header. Placeholder and body
  text now share one face and one size (14px), so the placeholder no longer jumps when
  you type — it simply becomes your text. Body size stays 14/22 per §5.2.
  This contradicts §5.2 ("body prose is always the body face"). `Typography.body-face`
  is the single switch to revert it.
- ✅ **Body gained 16px top padding**, so text no longer touches the header hairline.
  Padding is now even on all four sides of the body box. Costs 16px of body height
  against §7.3's numbers.
- ✅ **S1-04 done — a dev control cycles all seven strip states.** Ctrl+G with the body
  focused steps through idle / focused / syncing / offline / peers / peers-idle / error
  and back to live behaviour; the title displays which state is showing. This is the
  §14 Stage 1 DoD for the glyph strip.
- ✅ `docs/glyph-strip.md` written — what each of the seven states means, the four cell
  values, and why only idle and focused are currently reachable.

**Consequence to resolve before S1-32 (rich text):** Silkscreen ships Regular only — no
bold, no italic. §7.2 requires body bold at weight 600 and italic for rich text. With
Silkscreen as the body face, two of the five inline formats have no way to render.
Options when that lands: switch body back to the system sans, represent bold/italic
some other way, or drop them. Do not start S1-32 without deciding.
